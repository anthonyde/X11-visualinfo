This package provides a collection of Haskell FFI definitions for obtaining
information about X11 visuals from Xlib, including a VisualInfo type and
bindings for XGetVisualInfo() and XMatchVisualInfo(). These bindings are
missing from the X11 package as of version 1.6.0.2.

See man 3 XVisualInfo and http://tronche.com/gui/x/xlib/utilities/visual.html
for details.
